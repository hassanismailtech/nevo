## Problem Statement
Millions of neurodivergent students (ADHD, Autism, Dyslexia, Depression) in Nigeria and Africa face classrooms designed for the "average learner." Overcrowded schools, limited teacher resources, and lack of personalized support leave students disengaged and parents/teachers without guidance.

### Key Features
- **Diagnostic Onboarding:** Interactive assessments with local context, AI personalization, and multilingual support.
- **Adaptive Learning Engine:** Custom lessons based on student profile, pace, and interests; gamification drives engagement.
- **Teacher Empowerment:** Upload lessons, AI-driven personalization, actionable dashboards.
- **Parent Engagement:** Insightful dashboards, AI-guided support, progress tracking.

### Technical Components
- **AI Adaptive Engine** — Generates personalized lesson content and learning paths.
- **Diagnostic Engine** — Collects assessment data for accurate learning recommendations.
- **Gamification Module** — Badges, streaks, and points to motivate students.
- **Smart Dashboards** — Teachers and parents visualize progress and engagement metrics.
